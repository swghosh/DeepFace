Implementation of this paper have been done using Keras ([tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)). This project and necessary research was supported by the [TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc). [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) resources have been used to train a million-scale machine learning model using [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/).
